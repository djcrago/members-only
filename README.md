This is a website where users can post messages for others to see.

This was a full-stack project, where I demonstrated creating and authenticating users and giving users different abilities and permissions based on their status or lack thereof.

First-time visitors:

- Able to see a list of all messages, with the author’s name and date of message hidden.
- Able to sign-up and login.

Logged-in users:

- Able to see a list of all messages, with the author’s name and date of message hidden.
- Able to create messages.

Members:

- Able to see a list of all messages, with all information visible.
- Able to create messages.

Admins:

- Able to see a list of all messages, with all information visible.
- Able to create messages.
- Able to delete messages.

Other notable aspects of this project include:

- Using MongoDB to store and access data
- Using passportjs to authenticate users
- Using bcryptjs to hash passwords stored in the database
- Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture
- Working with the view template-engine pug
- Using luxon to format dates
